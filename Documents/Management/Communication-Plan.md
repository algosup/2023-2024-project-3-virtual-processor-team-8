# Communication Plan

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a virtual processor[^1] and an interpreter[^2] for executing assembly[^3] code on the proposed processor. The project will be implemented in plain, portable C language without external libraries, with the recommended use of gcc[^4] as a compiler and Visual Studio Code[^5] as the IDE[^6].

## Escalation Plan

The escalation plan outlines the procedures for addressing and escalating issues or concerns within the project. It ensures a systematic approach to resolving problems and maintaining effective communication.

📁 Take a look at the [Risk Management Plan](Risk-Management-Plan.md) for additional informatio.

### Escalation Levels

#### Level 1 - Project Team

- **Objective:** Address and resolve issues within the project team.
- **Responsibility:** Team members and project manager.
- **Communication Channel:** Direct communication within the project team.
  - Slack
  - team meeting
- **Response Time:** Immediate or during the next scheduled team meeting.

#### Level 2 - Project Manager

- **Objective:** Escalate issues beyond the project team for resolution.
- **Responsibility:** Project manager.
- **Communication Channel:** Email or scheduled one-on-one meeting.
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours.

#### Level 3 - Stakeholder

- **Objective:** Address escalated issues that require higher-level intervention.
- **Responsibility:** Project manager escalates to stakeholder.
- **Communication Channel:** Scheduled meeting with the stakeholder.
- **Response Time:** At the next available stakeholder meeting.

#### Level 4 - Customer

- **Objective:** Resolve critical issues that impact the overall success of the project.
- **Responsibility:** Project manager escalates to customer.
- **Communication Channel:** Direct communication with the customer.
- **Response Time:** Immediate or within 48 hours.

💡 ```In this project we consider the stakeholder and the customer are the same person: ALGOSUP - Franck Jeannin```

### Escalation Procedure

1. **Identification of Issue:**
   - Team members identify and document the issue.
   - Evaluate if the issue can be resolved at Level 1.

2. **Communication:**
   - Communicate the issue to the relevant party at Level 1.
   - Provide sufficient details and context.

3. **Resolution at Level 1:**
   - Project team addresses and resolves the issue.
   - If resolved, document the solution and inform relevant stakeholders.

4. **Escalation to Level 2:**
   - If the issue persists, escalate to the project manager.
   - Clearly articulate the issue, attempted resolutions, and impact.

5. **Resolution at Level 2:**
   - Project manager addresses and resolves the issue.
   - Communicate the resolution to all relevant stakeholders.

6. **Escalation to Higher Levels (if necessary):**
   - If the issue remains unresolved, escalate to higher levels as needed.
   - Clearly communicate the urgency and impact.

7. **Documentation:**
   - Document all escalations, actions taken, and resolutions.
   - Maintain a log for future reference and improvement.

### Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review the effectiveness of the escalation plan.
- Gather feedback from team members and stakeholders.
- Update the plan as needed based on project dynamics.

## Training

To ensure seamless communication, all team members will undergo comprehensive training sessions.

This includes:

- Familiarization with communication tools such as Trello and Slack.
- Understanding communication protocols and the frequency of updates.
- Guidance on accessing and contributing to the centralized documentation repository.
- Clear instructions on participating in project meetings and utilizing email updates and Slack channels.

The training and onboarding process aims to empower team members to effectively engage in project communication, fostering collaboration and a shared understanding of communication practices.

## Project Events

### Milestone Celebrations

To celebrate significant project milestones, the team will organize special events to recognize achievements and boost morale. These events will be communicated through the following channels:

- **Project Meetings:** Announcement and discussion during regular team meetings to share the importance of the milestone and acknowledge team contributions.

- **Project Management Tools:** Trello will be used to create special boards or cards to mark milestone achievements. This visual representation will serve as a reminder and celebration space for the team.

### Project Reviews

Scheduled project reviews will be conducted to assess progress, identify areas for improvement, and ensure alignment with project goals. Communication for project reviews will include:

- **Project Meetings:** Reviews will be discussed in detail during team meetings, providing an opportunity for open dialogue and addressing any concerns.

- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation of project reviews will be maintained in the central repository, accessible to all team members for reference and future planning.

### Other Planned Events

Any other planned events relevant to the project will be communicated using a combination of the above channels, ensuring that all stakeholders are well-informed and engaged in project activities.

## Metrics

Metrics will be defined to measure the effectiveness of communication. Examples include:

- **Feedback Response Rate:** Percentage of team members and stakeholders providing feedback on communications.
- **Attendance at Project Meetings:** Regular monitoring of attendance to assess engagement and participation.
- **Timeliness of Responses:** Evaluation of response times to critical project-related communications.
