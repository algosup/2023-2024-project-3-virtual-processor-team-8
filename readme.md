# Virtual Processor Project - Team 8
Welcome to the GitHub repository for Team 8's Virtual Processor Project for 2023-2024! This project is an ambitious undertaking aimed at creating a virtual processor and an interpreter capable of running assembly code. Our team, comprised of skilled and dedicated members, is committed to developing a high-quality, efficient, and user-friendly virtual processor.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a virtual processor along with an interpreter that executes assembly code specifically designed for this processor. The development is focused on using plain, portable C language, utilizing only the C standard libraries. This ensures wide compatibility and ease of use.

## Key Features

**Minimal Assembly Language:** Designing a custom assembly language tailored for the virtual processor.

**C Program Interpreter:** A C program that reads and runs assembly code, ensuring semantic validity and syntax error detection.

**Virtual System Call:** Implementing a system call for text display in a virtual terminal, accessible from the assembly code.

**Built-in Debugger:** Enhancing the interpreter with debugging capabilities to monitor the execution process.

**Unit Tests:** Developing assembly programs that function as unit tests to validate the performance of the virtual processor.
