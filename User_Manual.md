## Syntax description

Our virtual processor uses a custom assembly language, largely inspired by the original one. 

Here is a list of all the instructions and registers available. It is important to note that the syntax is case-sensitive. 

### Instructions

#### Arithmetic

- `ADD` : Add the value of the second operand to the first one
- `SUB` : Subtract the value of the second operand from the first one
- `MUL` : Multiply the value of the first operand by the second one
- `DIV` : Divide the value of the first operand by the second one

#### Logic

- `AND` : Perform a bitwise AND operation on the two operands
- `OR` : Perform a bitwise OR operation on the two operands
- `XOR` : Perform a bitwise XOR operation on the two operands
- `NOT` : Perform a bitwise NOT operation on the first operand
