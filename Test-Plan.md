## 1. Introduction

### A. Overview
We were asked to create a virtual processor and an interpreter to execute a lookalike assembly language. It has to be made in the C language, and has to be portable. The compiler used is gcc and the IDE is Visual Studio Code.


### B. Hardware and software
During the project, we will use computers running on Windows and MAC OS. The language used is C, and the assembly language that will be executed by the program created will be written in a .txt file.



## 2. Test strategy and criteria

### A. Quality assurance team
For this project, we will collaborate with the QAs of team 7, for a total of 4 QAs :

From team 8 :
- Laurent BOUQUIN
- Evan UHRING

From team 7 :
- Abderrazaq MAKRAN
- Raphaël PROUDHON

With this collaboration, knowledge and expertise will be shared for a better quality of testing, and thus having more results to help our project solving problems and assuring a better quality.


### B. Testing scope and method
We will verify the quality of the program, as well as every documents.

For the documents, we will verify the content, as well as the syntax and the grammar, to be sure that no misunderstanding is left over, and thus having clear and readable documents for the client, and also for the team.

For the program, we will test each functionalities and verify that they correspond with what was defined in the functional specification.

## 4. Schedule estimation
It is necessary to correctly spread out our time between each task, so we can be more efficient on the tests we have to do. Our total number of hours we have is 98 hours.

| Task | Subtask | Time estimation |
|------|---------|-------------|
|Analyse requirement specification| - Review functional specifications <br> - Review technical specification| - 6 hours <br> - 6 hours
| Create the test specification|  - Create the test plan <br> - Create test cases <br> - Review the test cases|- 30 hours <br> - 10 hours <br> - 4 hours
|Execute the test cases| - Build up the test environment <br> - Execute the test cases <br> - Update test cases status|- 10 hours <br> - 14 hours <br> - 6 hours
|Report the bug| - Create bug reports <br> - Create bug data report | - 6 hours <br> - 6 hours

If this estimation is correct, we will have spent 98 hours for the quality assurance of the project, as our number of working time we have available.



## 5. Deliverables
- **Test plan:** define the testing strategy and how the tests will be done.
- **Test cases:** define all the test that will be done to be sure that the program works as intended.
- **Bug reports:** report all the bugs that have been found during the tests.
