## 1. Introduction

### A. Overview
We were asked to create a virtual processor and an interpreter to execute a lookalike assembly language. It has to be made in the C language, and has to be portable. The compiler used is gcc and the IDE is Visual Studio Code.


### B. Hardware and software
During the project, we will use computers running on Windows and MAC OS. The language used is C, and the assembly language that will be executed by the programme created will be written in a .txt file.



## 2. Test strategy and criteria

### A. Quality assurance team
For this project, we will collaborate with the QAs of team 7, for a total of 4 QAs :

From team 8 :
- Laurent BOUQUIN
- Evan UHRING

From team 7 :
- Abderrazaq MAKRAN
- Raphaël PROUDHON

With this collaboration, knowledge and expertise will be shared for a better quality of testing, and thus having more results to help our project solving problems and assuring a better quality.


### B. Testing scope and method
We will verify the quality of the programme, as well as every documents.

For the documents, we will verify the content, as well as the syntax and the grammar, to be sure that no misunderstanding is left over, and thus having clear and readable documents for the client, and also for the team.

For the programme, we will test each functionalities and verify that they correspond with what was defined in the functional specification.
